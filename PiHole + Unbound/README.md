I will probably add more stuff here and there, I'll link the docs in a later commit. etc etc.

My example and the original differ in several ways, most importantly the traefik labels. Please edit them to suit your setup, ID the domain and tld. I linked the original from Chriscrowe's GH. Edit the .env file to suit your needs as well.
