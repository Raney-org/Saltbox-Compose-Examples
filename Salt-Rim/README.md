This is currently a work in progress, and I'd appreciate any help anyone is willing to give on this. Obviously, change all the occurences of `.domain.tld`, and anything that is redacted. Adjust anything that suits your needs. As it is currently set up, salt-rim will not connect to bar-assistant. but bar assistant connects to meilisearch, redis works fine and connects to everything. They all show in traefik dash. Something isn't jiving with traefik or something. I'm not sure.
